# Project Shutdown Notice

Hey Everyone,

We hope you're all doing well. We’ve got some tough news to share OSA-Bridge is shutting down. 

Despite putting in a lot of hard work and effort, we ran into some challenges that we just couldn’t overcome and after a lot of thought, we’ve decided that closing the project is the best way forward.
As the code was aquired, all outstanding compensations have been paid out and the entire codebase has been moved to private. You may still use earlier versions of the code as you please under its 
original license.

A Big Thanks

We want to give a huge shoutout to everyone who supported us—your enthusiasm and contributions have meant a lot. We genuinely appreciate all the trust and support you’ve shown us.
A special shoutout to all our freelancers and the amazing community who made this project possible in the first place.

What’s Next

All tokens associated have been successfully exchanged as per the project’s closure roadmap and any associated smart contracts and operational processes have been terminated.
The protocol has been officially ended and been fully liquidated.

If for whatever reason you have remaining issues after this closure, we’re here to help with the transition. For inquiries you can reach us as before at:

A Look Ahead

Despite the closure of the OSA-Chain Bridge protocol this project is a testament to the transformative power of decentralized finance. We were able to achieve our objectives without the traditional
constraints of a formal employment structure. Multi-signature wallets, made trustless payments a reality and we believe this model represents the future of innovation, enabling wider access to
community-driven projects.

Final Thoughts

We want to extend our deepest gratitude to all our community members, investors, and partners for your support and engagement throughout the life of the project.
Your contributions and enthusiasm have been invaluable.

Thanks for being part of the OSA-Bridge journey. We wish you all the best and hope to stay in touch.



Cheers,

your OSA-Chain Team
